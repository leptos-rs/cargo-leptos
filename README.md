# Getting started

Install:

> `cargo install --locked cargo-leptos`

If you, for any reason, need the bleeding-edge super fresh version:

> `cargo install --git https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos --locked cargo-leptos`

Help:

> `cargo leptos --help`

For setting up your project, have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/leptos-rs/cargo-leptos/tree/main/examples)

<br/>

## Dependencies

The dependencies for [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install), [wasm-opt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) and
[cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate#installation) are automatically installed in a cache directory
when they are used if they are not already installed and found by [which](https://crates.io/crates/which).
Different versions of the dependencies might accumulate in this directory, so feel free to delete it.

| OS      | Example                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | /home/alice/.cache/cargo-leptos           |
| macOS   | /Users/Alice/Library/Caches/cargo-leptos  |
| Windows | C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local\cargo-leptos |

If you wish to make it mandatory to install your dependencies, or are using Nix or NixOs, you can
install it with the `no_downloads` feature enabled to prevent cargo-leptos from trying to download and install them.

> `cargo install --features no_downloads --locked cargo-leptos`

<br/>

# Single-package setup

The single-package setup is where the code for both the frontend and the server is defined in a single package.

Configuration parameters are defined in the package `Cargo.toml` section `[package.metadata.leptos]`. See the Parameters reference for
a full list of parameters that can be used. All paths are relative to the package root (i.e. to the `Cargo.toml` file)

<br/>

# Workspace setup

When using a workspace setup both single-package and multi-package projects are supported. The latter is when the frontend
and the server reside in different packages.

All workspace members whose `Cargo.toml` define the `[package.metadata.leptos]` section are automatically included as Leptos
single-package projects. The multi-package projects are defined on the workspace level in the `Cargo.toml`'s
section `[[workspace.metadata.leptos]]` which takes three mandatory parameters:

```toml
[[workspace.metadata.leptos]]
# project name
name = "leptos-project"
bin-package = "server"
lib-package = "front"

# more configuration parameters...
```

Note the double braces: several projects can be defined and one package can be used in several projects.

<br/>

# Build features

When building with cargo-leptos, the frontend, library package, is compiled into wasm using target
`wasm-unknown-unknown` and the features `--no-default-features --features=hydrate`
The server binary is compiled with the features `--no-default-features --features=ssr`

<br/>

# Parameters reference

These parameters are used either in the workspace section `[[workspace.metadata.leptos]]` or the package,
for single-package setups, section `[package.metadata.leptos]`.

Note that the Cargo Manifest uses the word _target_ with two different meanings.
As a package's configured `[[bin]]` targets and as the compiled output target triple.
Here, the latter is referred to as _target-triple_.

## Compilation parameters

```toml
# Sets the name of the binary target used.
#
# Optional, only necessary if the bin-package defines more than one target
bin-target = "my-bin-name"

# Enables additional file hashes on outputted css, js, and wasm files
#
# Optional: Defaults to false. Can also be set with the LEPTOS_HASH_FILES=false env var (must be set at runtime too)
hash-files = false

# Sets the name for the file cargo-leptos uses to track the most recent hashes
#
# Optional: Defaults to "hash.txt". Can also be set with the LEPTOS_HASH_FILE_NAME="hash.txt" env var
hash-file-name = "hash.txt"

# The features to use when compiling all targets
#
# Optional. Can be extended with the command line parameter --features
features = []

# The features to use when compiling the bin target
#
# Optional. Can be over-ridden with the command line parameter --bin-features

#
# Optional. No default. Env: LEPTOS_BIN_CARGO_COMMAND
bin-cargo-command = "cross"
```

## Site parameters

These parameters can be overridden by setting the corresponding environment variable. They can also be
set in a `.env` file as cargo-leptos reads the first it finds in the package or workspace directory and
any parent directory.

```toml
# Sets the name of the output js, wasm and css files.
#
# Optional, defaults to the lib package name or, in a workspace, the project name. Env: LEPTOS_OUTPUT_NAME.
output-name = "myproj"

# The site root folder is where cargo-leptos generate all output.
# NOTE: It is relative to the workspace root when running in a workspace.
# WARNING: all content of this folder will be erased on a rebuild!
#
# Optional, defaults to "/site" in the Cargo target directory. Env: LEPTOS_SITE_ROOT.
site-root = "target/site"

# The site-root relative folder where all compiled output (JS, WASM and CSS) is written.
#
# Optional, defaults to "pkg". Env: LEPTOS_SITE_PKG_DIR.
site-pkg-dir = "pkg"

# The source style file. If it ends with _.sass_ or _.scss_ then it will be compiled by `dart-sass`
# into CSS and processed by lightning css. When release is set, then it will also be minified.
#
# Optional. Env: LEPTOS_STYLE_FILE.
style-file = "style/main.scss"

# The tailwind input file.
#
# Optional, Activates the tailwind build
tailwind-input-file = "style/tailwind.css"

# The tailwind config file.
#
# Optional, defaults to "tailwind.config.js" which if is not present
# is generated for you
tailwind-config-file = "tailwind.config.js"

# The browserlist https://browsersl.ist query used for optimizing the CSS.
#
# Optional, defaults to "defaults". Env: LEPTOS_BROWSERQUERY.
browserquery = "defaults"

# Assets source dir. All files found here will be copied and synchronized to site-root.
# The assets-dir cannot have a sub directory with the same name/path as site-pkg-dir.
#
# Optional. Env: LEPTOS_ASSETS_DIR.
assets-dir = "assets"

# JS source dir. `wasm-bindgen` has the option to include JS snippets from JS files
# with `#[wasm_bindgen(module = "/js/foo.js")]`. A change in any JS file in this dir
# will trigger a rebuild.
#
# Optional. Defaults to "src"
js-dir = "src"

# Additional files your application could depends on.
# A change to any file in those directories will trigger a rebuild.
#
# Optional.
watch-additional-files = ["additional_files", "custom_config.json"]

# The IP and port where the server serves the content. Use it in your server setup.
#
# Optional, defaults to 127.0.0.1:3000. Env: LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR.
site-addr = "127.0.0.1:3000"

# The port number used by the reload server (only used in watch mode).
#
# Optional, defaults 3001. Env: LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT
reload-port = 3001

# The command used for running end-to-end tests. See the section about End-to-end testing.
#
# Optional. Env: LEPTOS_END2END_CMD.
end2end-cmd = "npx playwright test"

# The directory from which the end-to-end tests are run.
#
# Optional. Env: LEPTOS_END2END_DIR
end2end-dir = "integration"
```

<br/>

## Environment variables

The following environment variables are set when compiling the lib (front) or bin (server) and when the server is run.

Echoed from the Leptos config:

- LEPTOS_OUTPUT_NAME
- LEPTOS_SITE_ROOT
- LEPTOS_SITE_PKG_DIR
- LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR
- LEPTOS_RELOAD_PORT

Directories used when building:

- LEPTOS_LIB_DIR: The path (relative to the working directory) to the library package
- LEPTOS_BIN_DIR: The path (relative to the working directory) to the binary package

Note when using directories:

- `cargo-leptos` changes the working directory to the project root or if in a workspace, the workspace root before building and running.
- the two are set to the same value when running in a single-package config.
- Avoid using them at run-time unless you can guarantee that the entire project struct is available at runtime as well.

Internally the versions of the external tools called by `cargo-leptos` are hardcoded. Use these environment variables to
override the versions `cargo-leptos` should use (e.g. `LEPTOS_SASS_VERSION=1.69.5`):

- LEPTOS_CARGO_GENERATE_VERSION
- LEPTOS_TAILWIND_VERSION
- LEPTOS_SASS_VERSION
- LEPTOS_WASM_OPT_VERSION

## End-to-end testing

`cargo-leptos` provides end-to-end testing support for convenience. It is a simple
wrapper around a shell command `end2end-cmd` that is executed in a specific directory `end2end-dir`.

The `end2end-cmd` can be any shell command. For running [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) it
would be `npx playwright test`.

What it does is equivalent to running this manually:

- in a terminal, run `cargo leptos watch`
- in a separate terminal, change to the `end2end-dir` and run the `end2end-cmd`.

When testing the setup, please try the above first. If that works but `cargo leptos end-to-end`
doesn't then please create a GitHub ticket.
